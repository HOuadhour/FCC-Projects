# Markdown Previewer

The project number two in the curriculum [**Front End Libraries Certifications**](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/)

---

## Getting Started

This project written using `react` with the help of the `CSS` preprocessor `SASS(scss)`.

The main styling inside `src/assets/style.scss` and not `src/assets/style.css`.

So it is recommended to modify the `sass` file then convert it to a `css` file.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

Install all the dependencies required for the project to run.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
