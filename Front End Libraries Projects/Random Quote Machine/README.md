## Getting Started

This project written using `html`, `CSS`, `JavaScript` with the help of the frontend libraries `jQuery`, `Bootstrap`, the `CSS` prprocessor `SASS(scss)` and some icons from `fontAwesome`.

The main styling inside `assets/main.scss` and not `assets/main.css`.

So it is recommended to modify the `sass` file then convert it to a `css` file.
