# APIs and Microservices Projects

You've worked with APIs before, but now that you know npm, Node, Express, MongoDB, and Mongoose, it's time to build your own. Draw on everything you've learned up to this point to create 5 different microservices, which are smaller applications that are limited in scope.

2. [Request Header Parser Microservice](https://github.com/HOuadhour/Request-Header-Parser-Microservice)
3. [URL Shortener Microservice](https://github.com/HOuadhour/URL-Shortener-Microservice)
