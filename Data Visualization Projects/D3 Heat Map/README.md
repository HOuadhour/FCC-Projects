## Getting Started

This project written using `html`, `CSS`, `JavaScript` with the help of the library `d3` and the `CSS` preprocessor `SASS(scss)`.

The main styling inside `assets/style.scss` and not `assets/style.css`.

So it is recommended to modify the `sass` file then convert it to a `css` file.
