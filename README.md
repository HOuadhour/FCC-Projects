# freeCodeCamp Projects

freeCodeCamp or FCC for short, it is not just an another website for teaching.
It is a whole new world for any one interesting in learning Web Development mainly and other fields like Machine Learning.

## What makes it unique?

The method of teaching is interactive and you learn by doing, you learn the most important things that you will need in real world situations.
And at the end of every course, you won't answer some dummy quiz questions to test your knowledge.

No you have to create 5 projects and after creating them you will get a verified certification for free, which is signed by **Quincy Larson**.

Thanks freeCodeCamp for this work.
